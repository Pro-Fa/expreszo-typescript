ExpresZo Typescript
==================================

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pro-fa/expreszo.svg?maxAge=3600)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pro-fa/expreszo)

## Description

A versatile expression evaluation library that goes beyond mathematical expressions. It parses and evaluates expressions that can manipulate strings, objects, and arrays, providing a safer alternative to JavaScript's `eval` function.

It has built-in support for common math operators and functions. Additionally, you can add your own JavaScript functions. Expressions can be evaluated directly, or compiled into native JavaScript functions.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @pro-fa/expreszo
```

## Quick Start

```js
import { Parser } from '@pro-fa/expreszo';

const parser = new Parser();
const expr = parser.parse('2 * x + 1');
console.log(expr.evaluate({ x: 3 })); // 7

// or evaluate directly
Parser.evaluate('6 * x', { x: 7 }); // 42
```

## Playground Example

Try out the expression evaluator and its language server capabilities directly in your browser at the [Playground](https://pro-fa.github.io/expreszo-typescript/). The playground provides an interactive environment with:
- Live expression evaluation
- Code completions and IntelliSense
- Syntax highlighting
- Hover information for functions and variables

cd <project-directory>
npm install
npm test
```

## Performance Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
npm run bench

# Run specific categories
npm run bench:parsing     # Parser performance
npm run bench:evaluation  # Evaluation performance
npm run bench:memory      # Memory usage
```

See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) for detailed performance documentation.

## Serving Documentation Locally

The documentation can be served locally using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### Prerequisites

Install MkDocs Material (requires Python):

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

### Serve Documentation

```bash
# Start local documentation server
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with live reload.

### Build Static Site

```bash
# Build static HTML files
mkdocs build
```

The static site will be generated in the `site/` directory.

## Origins

This library was originally based on [expr-eval 2.0.2](http://silentmatt.com/javascript-expression-evaluator/), but has been restructured with a modular architecture, TypeScript support, and comprehensive testing using Vitest.

While the original expr-eval was focused on mathematical expressions, this library aims to be a tool for evaluating expressions that can manipulate strings, objects, and arrays.
